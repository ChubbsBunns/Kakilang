# Kakilang Social Website for Orbital

## **Proposal for Orbital 2022**

### **Team Name:** 

Ropasalis

### **Proposed Level of Achievement:**

Project Gemini

### **Motivation**

Due to the advent of **Covid**, **community life** (Under the context of
halls and residential colleges) within NUS has taken an **adverse turn**
as meeting new people have become harder. Even though there are
platforms that allow one to meet new people within the community (e.g.
interest groups/ CCAs), there is **no platform** that has the **sole
purpose of allowing you to meet new people within your own community**.

Other groups usually have an **unspoken requirement that acts as a
barrier** that prevents people from meeting others.

For example, interest groups/CCAs usually require you to have an
interest in the particular skill in order to join them, House/Faculty
activities are very daunting to go in alone as friends usually go to
these activities together et cetera.

But providing **a platform solely for meeting new people** sets that one
goal as the expectation, **mitigating the previously said social
barriers**.

### **Aim**

We hope to be able to make a social platform that allows people within
the same community to connect with one another more easily, allowing
more people to know more people within their own community.

### **User Stories**

1. As a Year 1, I wish to meet more people/freshies in my own batch and
in my own hall/residential college as I am new to the community.

2. As a senior, I wish to meet new freshies/juniors who come into my
residential college/hall.

3. As a community head, I wish to be able to facilitate activities to
help bond my own community.

4. As a NUS student, I wish to find other students that enjoy the same hobbies and activities 
(CCAs) as I do.

### **Features, Timeline and Scope of Project**
The **Web App** is a social platform for students to better find and interact with each other.

    b. Links with NUSMODS to show each person’s timetable, allowing for
ease of setting up group meetings.

3. “Get to know you” Events.

to initiate “Get to know you” Events.

    b. These events groups people together in groups of x, where x is a
number decided by the admin user. This creates a group for each group of
people to chat with one another and get to know each other. There could
be preset tasks (e.g. go for a meal, watch a movie together) that the
admin leader could implement for them to motivate them to go out
together with a prize at the end of the event for each group.
